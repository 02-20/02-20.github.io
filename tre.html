        Getting Closer to Characters Through Table-Reading
        <div class="text">
        I believed that table-reading, a form of miniature play, could aid in understanding each character's personality and their interactions. This immersive process involves embodying a character and observing the performances of others. Expecting that experiencing conflicts would be best, I chose to table-read "Top Girls," a play filled with interrupted conversations among multiple characters.

        However, comprehending the content of "Top Girls" was quite difficult. Unlike "A Taste of Honey," where I found support in blind reading and listening to radio dramas, the experimental structure of "Top Girls" made understanding it difficult, even through visual media on YouTube, because of the fact that the video also employed an experimental, documentary-style narrative. To cope with this, I turned to the Korean translation book of the play, "최상의 여성들(오경심 역)," which I found in the library. I focused on absorbing the overall impression of the drama in Korean, temporarily setting aside my English studies. After reading, it struck me that each character left a strong impression, not as traditional heroes or protagonists, but as individuals with inconsiderate or irritating personalities - some could even be seen as villains. Moreover, the dialogues were realistic yet dramatic.

        Returning to the table-read, our initial choice was the first promotional party scene, which suited our group of four members well and progressed smoothly. However, due to the unexpected absence of one member the day before the presentation, I proposed an alternative: a scene featuring MRS KIDD, a character I found particularly enjoyable.

        MRS KIDD, Howard's wife, verbally sparring with Marlene standing for Howard. the construct between a wife and a career woman initially suggested a gender conflict, it ultimately revealed a battle among women. Upon closer inspection, MRS KIDD could be interpreted as a dedicated character who supports others, while Marlene, who neglects family, appeared as a selfish individual concerned solely with her own success. Or the scene could represent the struggle and dilemma faced by career-oriented women.

        As the table-read began, I found myself sympathizing with and rationalizing the characters as I try to portray them in the first person, causing my own personality to blend into theirs. In the first script, I played Marlene, whom I initially thought of as a snobby and unwise young character. However, as the table-read progressed, I strived to portray her as a calm, proud, and complex character regardless of my initial perception. Observing my partner's performance also offered a unique experience. These unforeseen experiences allowed me to see the characters as they were, and to apply them to various real-life cases. Like Marlene in this play, I could imagine many individuals in the world who might make judgments or misjudgments, becoming blinded by success, and losing or forsaking what is precious to them in the pursuit of ambition. It also prompted me to reflect on the attitude I should adopt while pursuing my values and living my life.
