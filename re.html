        My First Drama Reading: Character Exploration With Chat-GPT
        <div class="text">
            English class was a challenge and venture for me. One unexpected difficulty I faced, especially in writing, was the reading of English literature. I struggled to grasp the flows and nuances of the texts. My first reading of Delaney's 'A Taste of Honey' was filled with unfamiliar terms and I mostly read it in a dry tone, and stopped soon. In search of actors who read the text for me, I turned to <a href="radio.html">YouTube for a play video.</a> Eventually, I found BBC radio recording, which played a essential role in understanding the plot and characters through their tones, thanks to its immersive acting. The performances were so realistic that I empathized with Jo, even feeling unpleasant for days due to the tragedy in the play.
 
            In class, some classmates quickly made judgments like "Jo is rude and disrespectful to Helen," but I withheld judgement the characters. I wanted to understand them objectively. After first reading, Jo appeared merely as a confused child and a young protagonist, and Peter seemed to be a simple, cold-hearted, and vulgar adult character. Yet, It was a complex issue for me to determine whether Helen truly loved or wanted to get away the child Jo from herself. I also doubted why Geof was being kind to Jo, even if he is not related to her.
         
            Following that, I began to converse with openAI’s chat-gpt and search the web. The first question I asked was about who was Geof. And I continued to questioned about Geof and Helen. In that conversation, I got a common and objective understanding of the characters, just like how artificial intelligence learns from data.
        <a href="chat.html">Here you can see some conversations.</a>
        
        Particularly, the common interpretation of Geof as a gay character was hard for me to understand. I wondered if it was simply because he was gentle. Jo and Geof have respect and affection for each other, and there was only one incident where physical touch was refused by Jo. Also, the rejection of the proposal might be interpreted as an issue related to Jo's fears about the future or values about parents.
         
            On the other hand, the relationship between Helen and Jo was also worth discussing. But the more I read, the more sick I became of their toxic relationship, and I found myself wishing they would separate quickly. I acknowledged that characters like Helen would have their own personality backgrounds. I also believe it is hard to change someone, but relationships can be chosen for oneself. So, I wished they would forge better relationships. As a result, I started writing a Close Reading Essay wishing Jo would leave Helen and live with Geof.
         
            After drafting the initial version, the struggle of reading caught me again. I felt something was off in the flow of my writing, but I couldn't exactly point out what it was. During this time, a peer review was a great help. Through feedback on my draft, I was able to confirm that how students, who were good at reading, felt about my essay, and whether it wasn't something only I could understand because it was my writing. Fortunately, I received reviews that my topic was remarkable.
         
            As the semester progressed, my concentration on English waned, and I missed the peer review for the final draft. I tried to catch up with the class content and asked chat-gpt to serve as a peer. The responses from chat-gpt were not concise and filled with formal compliments, making it difficult to discern, but it gave hints about parts that could be improved. Some of this content was consistent with the professor's advice. Hence, with confidence in this feedback, I managed to use it as a guiding light to revise my essay, even in a state of declining concentration.
